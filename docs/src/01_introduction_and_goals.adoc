== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

WIChat is an enhanced version of the experimental quiz application developed last year by HappySw for RTVE. The main improvement is the incorporation of a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM), allowing contestants to interact and receive hints during the game. The application automatically generates questions and images using data from Wikidata, offering a wide range of topics and visual content. It also includes features such as user registration, individual game rankings, global rankings across all users, options to modify account details, and viewing general user data. All of this makes the game more engaging and personalized. WIChat is a web platform designed to be scalable, flexible, and easily maintainable, providing an interactive, fun, and educational experience for users.

=== Essential Functional Requirements:

* *User registration and authentication*: 
    ** Users can create accounts and log in to participate in the quiz.

* *Question and answer game*: 
    ** Menu for selecting question type and maximum response time per question. 
    ** Display of images to contestants, who must guess the place or topic shown. 
    ** Inclusion of image-related questions within the chatbot. 
    ** Reward users for each correct answer.

* *Interactive hint functionality*: 
    ** Users can request hints about answers conversationally. 
    ** Hints will be generated using an external large language model (LLM).

* *Automatic content generation*: 
    ** Images and hints will be automatically generated based on data retrieved from Wikidata.

=== Driving Forces:

* *Improved user interaction*: 
    ** Including conversational hints aims to increase user engagement and participation.

* *Content automation*: 
    ** Automatically generating images and hints reduces manual work and helps keep the content updated and diverse.

* *Alignment with modern technologies*:
    ** Integrating an LLM and using Wikidata positions the application at the technological forefront, which is key for RTVE as an innovative public entity.

=== Motivation

From the end-user perspective, the WIChat system is created to enhance the user experience in the "Saber y Ganar" quiz show. The primary goal of the system modification is to increase participant interaction by allowing them to obtain hints conversationally through an external large language model (LLM). This enriches the gaming experience and facilitates participation by offering "assistance" via the chatbot.

The system is designed to better support players through chatbot-generated hints, while also raising the overall game quality by integrating advanced technology for the automatic generation of images and hints based on Wikidata data. This ensures that the content remains relevant, up-to-date, and non-repetitive, providing a richer and more engaging experience for users.

=== Quality Goals
