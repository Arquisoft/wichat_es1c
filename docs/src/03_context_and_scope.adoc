==== Communication Partners:
* *Users:* 
    ** The end-users interact with the system through the chatbot and other game features. They are provided feedback or hints within the game.
* *Web Application:* 
    ** The web application serves as the user interface and manages the presentation of the game, including the display of questions, answers, and interactions with other components of the system.
* *Backend Service:* 
    ** This service processes user actions, manages the game state, communicates with external services (like Wikidata and LLM), and provides necessary data to the web application.
* *Chatbot:* 
    ** The chatbot serves as a conversational interface for user interactions. It receives inputs in the form of questions or commands and generates responses that may provide hints or extra information.
* *Database:* 
    ** The database stores all relevant game information, such as the game state, user progress, and historical results.
* *Wikidata:* 
    ** An external data source accessed by the backend service to retrieve knowledge and information via SPARQL queries, which helps generate trivia questions and provide context.
* *LLM (Large Language Model):* 
    ** A complex model that processes user queries and generates responses or hints, adapting based on the wildcards used in the game.

| *Database*                   | A MongoDB database stores user data, including player profiles, scores, and game progress.

| *Wikidata*                   | The backend service retrieves data from Wikidata using SPARQL queries, providing general knowledge and information for the game.

| *LLM (Large Language Model)* | Used to process user questions and provide relevant hints, ensuring dynamic and meaningful interactions in the game.

| *Azure Cloud*                | Used for deploying the application, ensuring scalability, security, and availability of the system.

| *MongoDB*                    | A NoSQL database for storing all application data, including user information and trivia questions.

| *Web Browsers*                | Allow users to access the game once it is deployed, supporting various browsers.

| *React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS*| Technologies used for the frontend development of the game, providing an interactive and responsive user interface.
|===

* *Web Application:*
    * The game is played through the internet. Users connect to the system via HTTP requests, allowing access via web browsers.

* *Backend Service:*
    * This service manages all game-related data. It processes user actions, generates trivia questions, and interacts with the Large Language Model (LLM) to offer hints. It also calls external APIs for additional game data.

* *Database:*
    * The database, which is based on MongoDB, stores critical data like user profiles, scores, and game progress. It ensures persistent storage and retrieval of this information.

* *Wikidata:*
    * The backend service retrieves knowledge from Wikidata using SPARQL queries, which is then used to create trivia questions and provide game context.

* *LLM (Large Language Model):*
    * The LLM processes user questions and generates relevant hints or answers. It enables dynamic and intelligent interactions based on user inputs.

* *Azure Cloud:*
    * Azure Cloud is used for deploying the application, ensuring the system is scalable, secure, and available.

* *MongoDB:*
    * MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores all the application’s data, including user profiles and trivia questions, making it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured data.

* *Web Browsers:*
    * Web browsers serve as the platform for accessing the game, allowing users to interact with it across a variety of devices.

* *React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS:*
    * These technologies are used to develop the frontend of the game. React builds the interactive user interface, while JavaScript, HTML, and CSS manage the layout, functionality, and styling of the game’s web pages.
