== Solution Strategy

=== Technology Decisions
For the implementation of **WIChat**, we have selected the following technologies based on their ease of development, scalability, and compatibility with the project requirements:

- *Frontend:* React with TypeScript for an interactive and modular user interface.
- *Backend:* Node.js with Express to manage business logic, authentication, and data operations.
- *Database:* MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database optimized for flexible and scalable storage.
- *Authentication:* JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication without third-party dependencies.
- *Question Generation:* Use of queries to Wikidata via the backend to retrieve images and data.
- *Deployment:* Netlify for frontend hosting and a cloud-based platform (such as Render or AWS) for the backend.

=== Top-Level System Decomposition
The system follows a *frontend + dedicated backend architecture*, where all business logic is handled by a Node.js backend instead of serverless functions.

. *Presentation Layer (Frontend - React)*
** Implemented in React with TypeScript, providing an interactive experience.
** Communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to the Node.js API.

. *Business Logic Layer (Backend - Node.js & Express)*
** Manages question generation, answer validation, and data storage.
** Connects to Wikidata to retrieve questions and answers.
** Handles user authentication with JWT, generating and validating tokens.

. *Data Layer (MongoDB Atlas)*
** Stores information about users, generated questions, and game statistics.
** Optimized for flexible storage and efficient queries.

=== Architectural Patterns

- *Monolithic Backend Architecture:* The backend is implemented as a single Node.js application managing all API requests.
- *API Gateway:* The backend acts as a centralized API that receives requests from the frontend and processes the corresponding logic.
- *Event-Driven Architecture:* MongoDB enables real-time updates through triggers and change streams.

=== Design Patterns

- *Fa√ßade:* Centralizes calls to MongoDB Atlas and Wikidata within the backend API.
- *Observer:* MongoDB allows real-time subscriptions to data changes.
- *Lazy Loading:* Loads data progressively to optimize frontend performance.
- *Producer-Consumer:* A programmed auxiliar process runs to generate questions and answers, storing them in the database for the game service to use.

=== Decisions for Achieving Quality Goals
To ensure system quality, the following strategic decisions have been made:

|===
| *Quality Goal* | *Decision Taken*
| *Scalability* | Use of MongoDB Atlas and Node.js backend, ensuring efficient request handling.
| *Availability* | Deployment in a cloud-based environment with automatic scaling.
| *Security* | Implementation of JWT-based authentication for secure access control without third-party dependencies.
| *Maintainability* | Use of Express framework for a structured and maintainable backend.
| *Usability* | Intuitive web interface with React and automatic question generation to enhance user experience.
| *Mitigation of LLM Errors* | Use of specifically designed prompts to reduce incorrect responses and pre-filter generated hints.

=== Organizational Decisions

[options="header"]
|===
| Third Party Product | Reason
| Git | Easy to use distributed version control system.
| GitHub | Web-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories, including features like issues tracking, pull requests, and GitHub Actions.
| Netlify | Cloud service used for deploying the frontend with built-in support for continuous integration.
| MongoDB Atlas | Scalable and flexible cloud-based NoSQL database solution.
| JSON Web Tokens (JWT) | Secure and stateless authentication mechanism used to handle user sessions.
| Render / AWS | Cloud-based hosting service for the Node.js backend, ensuring scalability and reliability.

=== Motivation
The architectural decisions in this system are based on the need for an agile and efficient development approach within a **10-week academic environment**. A **Node.js backend with Express** was chosen to ensure greater control over business logic while maintaining scalability and ease of integration with React and MongoDB.
