== Solution Strategy

=== Technology Decisions
For the implementation of **WiChat**, we have selected the following technologies based on their ease of development, scalability, and compatibility with the project requirements:

- *Version Control:* Git – Distributed version control system that facilitates secure and collaborative source code management.
- *Repository Hosting:* GitHub – Cloud-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories, used for team collaboration, continuous integration, and automated deployment.
- *CI/CD Automation:* GitHub Actions – Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) service used to automate testing, Docker image builds, and deployments to production environments.
- *Code Quality:* SonarCloud – Continuous code quality analysis platform that detects bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and calculates test coverage to maintain high development standards.
- *Programming Language:* JavaScript – Dynamic programming language used on both frontend and backend to build interactive web applications.
- *Frontend Library:* React.js – JavaScript library focused on building efficient, modular, and interactive user interfaces on the frontend.
- *Styling Framework:* CSS with Tailwind – Utility-first CSS framework for quickly building modern, responsive, and highly customizable interfaces.
- *Runtime Environment:* Node.js – JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development, ideal for creating fast, scalable, and real-time backend services.
- *Web Framework:* Express – Minimalist Node.js framework that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs and the management of routes and middleware in the backend.
- *ODM Library:* Mongoose – Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a structured layer to define schemas and data models in Node.js.
- *Authentication:* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) – Token-based secure authentication standard used to manage user sessions without the need for server-side state.
- *Language Model:* Google Gemini (LLM) – Language model developed by Google to generate intelligent and personalized responses in chatbot interactions.
- *Knowledge Base:* Wikidata – Open, structured knowledge base that provides semantic data used to dynamically enrich game questions.
- *Testing Tool:* Puppeteer – Browser automation tool used to perform end-to-end testing of the application.
- *BDD Framework:* Cucumber – Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework used with Puppeteer to describe and run natural language test scenarios.
- *Testing Framework:* Jest – JavaScript testing framework used to perform unit and integration tests across various system services.
- *Load Testing:* Gatling – Load testing tool that simulates multiple concurrent users to analyze the performance and scalability of backend services.
- *Containerization:* Docker – Container platform that packages applications along with their dependencies, ensuring consistent deployments across environments.
- *Cloud Platform:* Azure – Cloud services platform where the virtual machines hosting the system's container deployments are located.

=== Top-Level System Decomposition
The system follows a *frontend + dedicated backend architecture*, where all business logic is managed by a Node.js backend instead of serverless functions.

. *Presentation Layer (Frontend - React)*
** Implemented in React with TypeScript, providing an interactive experience.
** Communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to the Node.js API.

. *Business Logic Layer (Backend - Node.js & Express)*
** Manages question generation, answer validation, and data storage.
** Connects to Wikidata to retrieve questions and answers.
** Handles user authentication with JWT, generating and validating tokens.

=== Architectural Patterns

The system effectively implements the following architectural patterns:

* *Microservices Architecture*:
- The backend is divided into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific business domain (user management, authentication, game logic, communication with the LLM).
- Each service is independent, enabling scalability, easier maintenance, and separate deployment of components.

* *API Gateway Pattern*:
- The Gateway Service centralizes all frontend requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.
- It handles request routing, JWT token validation, and protection of internal services.

* *RESTful API Design*:
- The microservices expose RESTful APIs following design standards that ensure clear, structured, and resource-based communication.

* *Containerization Pattern*:
- The entire system is packaged into Docker containers, ensuring environment consistency across development, testing, and production.

* *Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)*:
- Continuous integration is achieved via GitHub Actions, which automates unit and integration testing, code quality analysis (SonarCloud), and container deployments.

=== Design Patterns

- *Façade:* Centralizes calls to database and Wikidata within the backend API.
- *Lazy Loading:* Progressive data loading to optimize frontend performance.
- *Producer-Consumer:* A scheduled auxiliary process generates questions and answers, storing them in the database for the game service to use.

=== Decisions for Achieving Quality Goals
To ensure system quality, the following strategic decisions have been made:

[options="header"]
|===
| *Quality Goal* | *Decision Taken*
| *Scalability* | Use of database Atlas and Node.js backend, ensuring efficient request handling.
| *Availability* | Deployment in a cloud-based environment with automatic scaling.
| *Security* | Implementation of JWT-based authentication for secure access control without third-party dependencies.
| *Maintainability* | Use of the Express framework for a structured and maintainable backend.
| *Usability* | Intuitive web interface with React and automatic question generation to enhance the user experience.
| *Mitigation of LLM Errors* | Use of specifically designed prompts to reduce incorrect responses and pre-filter generated hints.
| *Reducing Question Loading Time* | Preloading questions so that while a user answers a question, the next one is already prepared, thus preventing delays.

|===
| Third-Party Product | Reason
| Git | Easy-to-use distributed version control system.
| GitHub | Web-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories, including features like issue tracking, pull requests, and GitHub Actions.
| Azure | Cloud service used for deploying the application with built-in support for continuous integration.
| JSON Web Tokens (JWT) | Secure and stateless authentication mechanism used to manage user sessions.
| Prometheus | Monitoring and alerting toolkit ideal for metrics collection.
| Grafana | Analytics and monitoring platform allowing real-time visualization of metrics.
| SonarQube | Static code analysis tool to ensure code quality and detect vulnerabilities.
| CodeScene | Code analysis tool that identifies complexity patterns and technical debt.
| Docker | Platform for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers, facilitating portability and scalability.

=== Motivation
The architectural decisions in this system are based on the need for an agile and efficient development approach within an **academic environment of a couple of months**. A **Node.js backend with Express** was chosen to ensure greater control over business logic while maintaining scalability and ease of integration with React.  
Additionally, the use of modern tools like **Prometheus and Grafana** was prioritized to guarantee real-time monitoring and metrics analysis, allowing proactive performance issue detection and resolution. The choice of cloud technologies like **WikiData** and **Azure** ensures that the system is scalable and accessible from anywhere.
