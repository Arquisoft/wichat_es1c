=== Runtime Scenario 1 - Playing a Game

The following diagram shows the interaction between the user and the most relevant modules of the application.

The interaction can be divided into the following steps:

* **Logging in:** The user logs into the application. If they do not have an account, they will need to register.
* **Starting the game:** Once logged in, the user can start a new game.
* **Answering the questions:** For each question, four possible answers will be generated. Once per question, its information (question, image, and possible answers) will be presented to the user through the graphical interface, and the system will wait for their response. After the user submits an answer, the score will be increased—or not—according to the selected answer.
* **Ending the game:** Once all questions have been answered, the GUI will display the final score.
* **Chatbot assistance:** During the game, the user may interact with a chatbot powered by a language model (LLM) to get hints or general assistance. 

Additional considerations:

* Despite its simplicity, this diagram assumes the user already has an account.
* The chatbot integration with the LLM may require an internet connection to process user requests.
