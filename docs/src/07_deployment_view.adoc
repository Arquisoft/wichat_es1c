== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

Motivation::

This deployment view represents how the WiChat system is distributed across its infrastructure. It helps clarify where each component runs, how they communicate, and how third-party services are integrated. This understanding supports scalability planning, maintenance, and performance optimization.

Infrastructure Overview::
The system is deployed using Docker containers, hosted on a Linux-based virtual machine in Microsoft Azure. Each backend service runs in its own container. The frontend is a React application executed in the client’s browser and communicates with the backend via REST APIs through a central gateway.

External Services::
