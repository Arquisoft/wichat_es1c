== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Concepts

#### Introduction
This section covers fundamental principles that influence various aspects of the system, ensuring consistency and proper functionality. It includes domain models, design principles, technologies used, and key architectural decisions.

#### Motivation
The use of cross-cutting concepts ensures the system's coherence, optimizing development and maintenance while enhancing security, scalability, and user experience.

#### Categories of Concepts
- **Domain Models**
- **User Experience (UX)**
- **Operational Concepts**
- **Architecture and Design Patterns**
- **Security and Data Protection**
- **Development Strategies**

Each of these is detailed below.

### Domain Models

#### Domain Structure
- **User:** An individual interacting with the application, capable of handling multiple concurrent sessions.
- **Game:** A feature allowing users to engage in individual challenges with different formats.
- **Stats:** A section displaying user performance, including total games, accuracy, and average scores.
- **Ranking:** Displays user rankings based on scores, correct answers, and playtime.

### User Experience (UX)
- **Intuitive Design:** A clear and accessible interface for easy navigation.
- **Accessibility Features:** Visual aids such as icons and colors to improve understanding.
- **Attractive design:** A beautiful and visually appealing app design.

---

### Operational Concepts
- **Ease of Use:** User testing conducted to enhance usability.
- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Adjustments made to improve the experience for all users.

---

### Security
- **Access Control:** Restriction of certain sections to authenticated users.
- **Data Protection:** Encrypted credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### Architecture and Design Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture:** The application is segmented into independent modules such as user management, question generation, and graphical interface.
- **Scalability:** The modular structure enables system expansion without compromising performance.

---

### Development Strategies
- **Automated Testing:** Implementation of unit and integration tests to validate system functionality.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Use of CI/CD pipelines to ensure active development and deployment processes.
