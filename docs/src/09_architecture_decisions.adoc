== Architecture Decisions

=== Overview
This section documents the key architectural decisions made during the development of **WIChat**. Each decision has been carefully analyzed considering technical feasibility, project constraints, scalability, and maintainability. Providing the rationale behind these decisions ensures transparency and facilitates traceability for all stakeholders.

=== Motivation
The architectural decisions were guided by the need to create a system that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy within the constraints of a university project. By adopting **Node.js and Express** for the backend, the project benefits from a robust and flexible framework capable of efficiently managing authentication, database interactions, and API operations.

=== Conclusion
The selected architectural approach supports the projectâ€™s objectives of rapid development, minimal operational overhead, and scalability. Future iterations of **WIChat** can build upon these foundations, refining the architecture based on real-world usage patterns and performance metrics.
