=== Motivation
The above decisions were made to ensure that **WIChat** is scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy within the constraints of a university project. By selecting **a dedicated backend with Node.js and Express**, we gain better control over the application’s logic while ensuring flexibility in handling authentication, database interactions, and API management.

=== Conclusion
These architectural choices align with the project’s goals of rapid development, minimal operational overhead, and scalability. Future iterations of the system can refine these choices based on usage patterns and performance considerations.
