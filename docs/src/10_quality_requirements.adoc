== Quality Requirements

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

| Description | Quality Attribute | Scenario
| The system must be available 24/7 with minimal downtime. | High Availability | Users can access the system at any time without interruptions.
| The architecture must support the addition of more servers without interrupting service. | Scalability | During peak hours, the system can distribute traffic across multiple servers without degrading performance.
| The application must ensure the protection of user data, particularly during registration and access. | Security | User credentials and personal data are encrypted and securely stored to prevent unauthorized access.
| The response time for displaying a question and its options should be under 2 seconds. | Performance | A contestant requests a new question, and the system presents it almost instantly.
| Images and clues must be generated correctly from Wikidata data without errors. | Integration with Wikidata | The chatbot retrieves information from Wikidata and provides accurate hints without inconsistencies.
| The user interface must be intuitive, with clear instructions on how to participate and get clues. | Usability | A new user can navigate the app without prior instructions and understand how to interact with the game.
