== Testing in the Project

=== Code Coverage
Code coverage is a metric used to measure what percentage of the source code is being executed by automated tests. In this project, unit tests have been implemented to ensure code quality and reliability.

|===
| Tool used | Jest
| Description | Jest is a testing framework for JavaScript that enables unit testing and code coverage measurement.
| Coverage achieved | Currently, the project has achieved 80.2% coverage (replace with actual value) in critical areas of the system, including business logic and backend controllers.
|===

=== End-to-End (E2E) Testing
End-to-end testing verifies the full functionality of the system, from the frontend to the backend, ensuring that the main application flows work correctly.

|===
| Tool used | Cypress
| Description | Cypress is an E2E testing framework that allows simulating user interactions in the browser and verifying system behavior.
| Flows tested |
- User registration.
- Login.
- Entering the game.
- Navigation through the application.

=== Usability Testing
Usability testing focuses on evaluating the system's user interface and overall user experience by observing real users as they interact with the application. These tests aim to identify any usability issues and ensure that the system is intuitive and user-friendly.

|===
| Method used | Moderated remote sessions and user feedback collection
| Description | Test participants were asked to complete typical tasks while being observed remotely. Post-session surveys were also collected to gather subjective impressions.
| Key findings |
- Users found the onboarding process clear and easy to follow.
- Navigation through the app was intuitive for the majority of testers.
- Minor issues were noted in the accessibility of some controls on smaller screens.
| Improvements made | Based on feedback, UI adjustments were made to improve mobile responsiveness and highlight primary action buttons.

==== Examples of Usability Tests
We asked several people of different age groups to test the application. Through these tests, we discovered errors in the graphical interface, the backend, and the internal workings of the LLM itself.


=== Test Results

|===
| Type of test | Result
| Unit tests | All unit tests have successfully passed, covering the main backend functions.
| E2E tests | The main application flows have been successfully validated, ensuring a smooth user experience.
| Usability tests | The main application has been tested by real people who have provided feedback on its performance.

=== Conclusion
The use of coverage and end-to-end testing has enabled early detection and correction of errors during development, improving system quality and reducing the risk of production failures. It is recommended to continue expanding test coverage and perform periodic end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure system stability. Thanks to Coverage testing, we have been able to review lines of code critical to development.
