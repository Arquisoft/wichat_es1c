==== Communication Partners:

* *Users:* 
** End users interact with the system through the chatbot and other game features. They are provided hints during gameplay.

* *Web Application:* 
** The web application acts as the user interface and manages the presentation of the game, including the display of questions, answers, and interactions with other system components.

* *Backend Service:* 
** This service processes user actions, manages the game state, communicates with external services (such as Wikidata and the LLM), and provides necessary data to the web application.

* *Chatbot:* 
** The chatbot serves as a conversational interface for user interactions. It receives inputs in the form of questions or commands and generates responses that may include hints or additional information.

* *Database:* 
** The database stores all relevant game information, such as the game state, user progress, and historical results.

* *Wikidata:* 
** An external data source accessed by the backend service to retrieve knowledge and information via SPARQL queries, helping to generate trivia questions and provide context.

* *LLM (Large Language Model):* 
** A complex model that processes user queries and generates answers or hints, adapting based on the wildcards used in the game.

* *Web Application:*
** The game is played over the internet. Users connect to the system via HTTP requests, allowing access through web browsers.

* *Backend Service:*
** This service manages all game-related data. It processes user actions, generates trivia questions, and interacts with the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide hints. It also makes calls to external APIs to retrieve additional data for the game.

* *Database:*
** The database, based on MongoDB, stores critical data such as user profiles, scores, and game progress, ensuring persistent storage and retrieval of this information.

* *Wikidata:*
** The backend service retrieves knowledge from Wikidata using SPARQL queries, which is used to create trivia questions and provide context for the game.

* *LLM (Large Language Model):*
** The LLM processes user questions and generates relevant hints or answers, allowing dynamic and intelligent interactions based on user inputs.

* *Azure Cloud:*
** Azure Cloud is used for deploying the application, ensuring that the system is scalable, secure, and highly available.

* *MongoDB:*
** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores all the application data, including user profiles and trivia questions, making it ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured data.

* *Web Browsers:*
** Web browsers serve as the platform for accessing the game, allowing users to interact with it from a variety of devices.

* *React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS:*
